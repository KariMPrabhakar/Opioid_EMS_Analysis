# Business Question - "What are the key factors associated with the administration of Narcan during opioid-related EMS calls, and how do these factors vary across different demographic groups, times of the day, or geographic locations?"


# Introduction

The opioid crisis remains a critical public health concern, with far-reaching implications for communities. This analysis aims to shed light on key factors associated with the administration of Narcan during opioid-related EMS calls for the data collected in Tempe, Arizona. By understanding these factors, we can enhance our response to opioid incidents and, ultimately, save lives.

# Graph 1: Temporal Distribution of Opioid Incidents - "Distribution of Opioid use Incidents Based on Time of Day." This graph gives insights into the broader distribution of opioid-related incidents, illustrating the temporal patterns of opioid-related incidents throughout the day. By examining the frequency of incidents at different times, we can identify peak periods and potential trends in opioid emergencies.

# Graph 4: Distribution of Gender - The bar plot illustrates the distribution of gender within the subset of opioid-related incidents where opioid use is recorded as 'Yes.' The visual representation showcases the count of male and female. This focused analysis provides insights into the gender distribution specifically among cases where opioids were confirmed to be used.

## Graph 5 - "Narcan Given Incidents Across Age Groups" - After exploring the relationship between age and Narcan given incidents using age bins, it is evident that age groups 19-30 and 31-45 have the highest counts of "Yes" responses to Narcan given across the age groups.

## Graph 6 - Narcan Given Incidents Across Specific Populations - Based on the analysis of Narcan given incidents across specific populations, it is observed that the homeless population has the highest count.


## Graph 7 : Narcan, or naloxone, is a medication that can rapidly reverse opioid overdose and is a key component in our efforts to address the opioid crisis. ## Note: Narcan may have been administered in incidents where opioid use was reported as 'No' due to factors such as observed symptoms, uncertainties in self-reporting, or other clinical considerations."Narcan Given Incidents Based on Time of Day"

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this presentation/report has explored key factors associated with Narcan administration during opioid-related EMS calls. The insights gained contribute to a better understanding of how Narcan can be strategically employed to address opioid emergencies and, in turn, enhance our overall response to the opioid crisis.


In conclusion, the analysis of opioid-related EMS calls and the administration of Narcan has shown key insights into factors associated with these incidents. Demographically, there is a notable concentration of Narcan administrations among individuals aged 19-30 and 31-45, with a higher prevalence among the homeless population. Temporally, the afternoon and evening exhibit heightened occurrences of opioid-related emergencies, emphasizing the need for strategic resource allocation during these periods. Additionally, a temporal analysis across years suggests a rising trend in opioid-related incidents from 2017 to 2021, with a subsequent decline in 2022. Geographically, Marina Heights, Cameron Way, Hermosa Drive, and Veteran's Way College show higher narcan administration incidences in the Tempe, Arizona area. Consideration of location-specific trends could further enrich the understanding of the opioid crisis. The Decision Tree Classifier model, incorporating demographic and temporal features, contributes predictive capabilities with a 66% precision in determining Narcan administrations. These findings collectively illuminate the multifaceted nature of opioid-related emergencies, offering valuable insights for targeted interventions, resource optimization, and comprehensive emergency response planning across diverse demographic groups and temporal contexts.
